# Critical-Heat-Flux-ML
Introduction:

Engineering problems with sophisticated physical phenomena may present extreme challenges to establishing explicit mathematical expressions or building credible input/output causality. One such engineering problem is the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) crisis in a two-phase flow boiling system. The DNB crisis is characterized by a sharp deterioration of the heat transfer coefficient at the heater/coolant interface, as vapor permanently blankets the heated surface, preventing access of supply liquid (which is subcooled or slightly saturated) and potentially leading to a set of cascading component failures. The corresponding heat flux, or critical heat flux (CHF), is a regulatory limit for commercial pressurized water reactors (PWRs) worldwide. 

The goal here is to try some machine learning algorithms to predict the CHF value, visualize the results and evaluate the errors associated.
